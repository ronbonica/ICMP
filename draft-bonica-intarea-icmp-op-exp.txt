1.  Introduction

   The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) can be used to exchange
   control information between hosts.  ICMPv4 [RFC0792] exchanges
   control information between IPv4 [RFC0791] hosts while ICMPv6
   [RFC4443] exchanges control information between IPv6 [RFC8200] hosts.

   This document summarizes ICMP standards and operational experience.
   The purpose of this document is to be used as a reference.  A
   document that mentions ICMP can reference this document rather than
   repeating portions of its content.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ICMP Message Types

   [RFC1122] and [RFC4443] make a distintion between ICMP error messages
   and ICMP information messages.  An ICMP error messages indicates that
   a downstream node recieved a packet that it could not process.
   [RFC0792] refers to the unprocessed packet as the "original data
   datagram", while [RFC4443] refers to the unprocessed packet as the
   "invoking packet".  In this document, we will adopt [RFC4443]
   terminology and call the unprocessed packet the "invoking packet".

   Having received an invoking packet, the downstream node can send an
   ICMP error message to its originator.  The ICMP error message
   indicates why the packet could not be processed.  It also includes as
   much of the invoking packet as possible, without violating the ICMP
   message length limitations mentioned in (Section 8.4).

   In ICMPv6, error messages are identified as such by a zero in the
   high-order bit of their message Type field values.  Thus, ICMPv6
   error messages have message types from 0 to 127.  ICMPv6
   informational messages have message types from 128 to 255.

   In ICMPv4, error messages cannot be identified as such by a zero in
   the high-order bit of their message Type field values.

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains one registy
   of ICMPv4 message types [V4MSG] and another registry of ICMPv6
   message types [V6MSG].  Many ICMPv4 message types have been
   deprecated.

3.1.  Message Processing

3.1.1.  Known ICMP Message Types

   According to [RFC1122] and [RFC4443], when a node receives an ICMP
   error message, it must examine the message to determine:

   *  whether the invoking packet originated on the local node

   *  which local application or transport-layer protocol originated the
      invoking packet

   If the invoking packet originated on the local node, the ICMP error
   message must be delivered to the application or transport-layer
   prototcol that originated it (if possible).  If the originating
   transport-layer protocol was the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
   [RFC0768], UDP must, in turn, deliver the ICMP error message to the
   application that caused the invoking packet to be sent.

   When a node receives an ICMP information message, the message must be
   delivered to the application that caused it to be sent (if possible).

3.1.2.  Unknown ICMP Message Types

   According to [RFC1122], if an ICMPv4 message of unknown type is
   received, it must be silently discarded.

   According to [RFC4443], if an ICMPv6 error message of unknown type is
   received, it must be passed to the upper-layer process that
   originated the invoking packet (if possible).  However, if an ICMP
   informatonal message of unknown type is received, it must be silently
   discarded.

4.  ICMP Restrictions

   According to [RFC1122], an ICMPv4 error message must not be sent as
   the result of receiving:

   *  an ICMP error message

   *  a datagram destined to an IP broadcast or IP multicast address

   *  a datagram sent as a link-layer broadcast

   *  a non-initial fragment

   *  a datagram whose source address does not define a single host
      (e.g., a zero address, a broadcast address, a multicast address)

   According to [RFC4443], an ICMPv4 error message must not be sent as
   the result of receiving:

   *  An ICMPv6 error message

   *  An ICMPv6 redirect message

   *  A packet destined to an IPv6 multicast address.

   *  A packet sent as a link-layer multicast

   *  A packet sent as a link-layer broadcast

   *  A packet whose source address does not uniquely identify a single
      node e.g., the IPv6 Unspecified Address, an IPv6 multicast
      address, or an address known by the ICMP message originator to be
      an IPv6 anycast address)

   The following are exceptions to the IPv6 multicast, link-layer
   multicast, and link_layer broadcast rules above:

   *  The Packet Too Big Message can be sent to allow Path MTU discovery
      to work for IPv6 multicast

   *  The Parameter Problem Message, reporting an unrecognized IPv6
      option that has the Option Type highest-order two bits set to 10
      can be sent

5.  Extensibility:

   Some ICMP messages are extensible [RFC4884].  However, the extension
   header MUST not cause the ICMP message to violate the length
   restrictions mentioned below.  IANA maintains a registry of ICMP
   Extension Object Classes and Class Sub-types
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-
   parameters.xhtml#icmp-parameters-ext-classes).

6.  Acceptable Uses

   [RFC7279] defines accpetable uses for ICMP.  The following are
   acceptable uses:

   *  to inform a datagram's originator that a forwarding plane anomaly
      has been encountered downstream.  The datagram originator must be
      able to determine whether or not the datagram was discarded by
      examining the ICMP message.

   *  to discover and convey dynamic information about a node (other
      than information usually carried in routing protocols), to
      discover and convey network-specific parameters, and to discover
      on-link routers and hosts.

   Normally, ICMP SHOULD NOT be used to implement a general-purpose
   routing or network management protocol.  However, ICMP does have a
   role to play in conveying dynamic information about a network, which
   would belong in the second catagory, above.

7.  Management Applications

   The following management applications rely on ICMP:

   *  PING [RFC2151]

   *  Traceroute [RFC2151]

   *  Traceroute with extensions for Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) [RFC4950]

   *  Traceroute with extensions for Interface and Next-Hop
      Identification [RFC5837]

   *  PROBE [RFC8335]

8.  General Issues

8.1.  Transport

   ICMP messages can be lost in transport.  Therefore, the originator of
   an ICMP message cannot rely on the message arriving at its intended
   destination.

8.2.  Rate Limits

   As per [RFC1812] and [RFC4443], nodes must rate limit ICMP messages
   that they originate.  Neither RFC specifies how strict that rate
   limit must be.  However, the rate limit MUST be strict enough to
   prevent a node from congesting one of its own interfaces with
   outbound ICMP messages.

8.3.  Forgery

   ICMP messages are easily forged.  [RFC5927] describes how forged ICMP
   messages can be used to attack TCP [RFC0793].  It also decribes
   mitigations against these attacks.

8.4.  Message Length

   As per [RFC1812], an ICMPv4 message must not exceed 576 bytes.
   [RFC4443] specifies no limit for ICMPv6 messages.  However, to avoid
   fragmentation, ICMPv6 messages SHOULD not exceed the IPv6 minimum
   required MTU [RFC8200] (i.e., 1280 bytes).

8.5.  Source Address Selection

   [RFC1812] offers the following guidance regarding ICMPv4 source
   address selection:

      Except where this document specifies otherwise, the IP source
      address in an ICMP message originated by the router MUST be one of
      the IP addresses associated with the physical interface over which
      the ICMP message is transmitted.  If the interface has no IP
      addresses associated with it, the router's router-id is used
      instead.

   However [RFC4443] offer different guidance regarding ICMPv6 source
   address selection:

      If the message is a response to a message sent to one of the
      node's unicast addresses, the Source Address of the reply MUST be
      that same address.

      If the message is a response to a message sent to any other
      address, the Source Address of the ICMPv6 packet MUST be a unicast
      address belonging to the node.  The address SHOULD be chosen
      according to the rules that would be used to select the source
      address for any other packet originated by the node, given the
      destination address of the packet.  However, it MAY be selected in
      an alternative way if this would lead to a more informative choice
      of address reachable from the destination of the ICMPv6 packet.

9.  Translation Considerations

   IPv4 hosts will often communicate with an IPv4 host through an IPv4/
   IPv4 translator [RFC5508] which may be located at the customer
   premise, ISP, or the server's datacenter.

   IPv6-only hosts may communicate with IPv4-only hosts through an IPv6/
   IPv4 translator which might be stateless ([RFC7915], [RFC6791]) or
   stateful ([RFC6146]), and may be located at the customer premise or
   ISP (as a NAT64 service).  Because of this translation, a received
   ICMP message will refer to the IPv4 host.

   IPv4 traffic may communicate with IPv6-only hosts through an IPv6/
   IPv4 translator located at the datacenter [RFC7755].  This requires
   no special handling for the IPv4 host.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any requests of IANA

11.  Security Considerations

   As this document does not introduce any new protocols or operational
   procedures, it does not introduce any new security considerations
